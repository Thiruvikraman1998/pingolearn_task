# pingolearn_task
The task application has been completed and published in this repository

App was structured with MVVM architecture, and met mostly all the edge cases and requirements.

App Screen and the firebase console screen were attached below.

Navigation while screen recording is not happening in my device. Unfortunately couldn't  upload the running app video.
